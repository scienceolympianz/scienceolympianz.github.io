    <h3>Who We Are</h3>

    <p>
      The NZ Mathematics Olympiad Committee is a dedicated committee of University lecturers and students, Mathematics
      teachers, and interested mathematicians who identify, select and mentor gifted and talented students through an
      annual programme of participation in international Olympiad competitions to give them an immense kick start to
      their mathematical careers. In turn former Olympians contribute to the next generations programmes by joining the
      committee and running the mentor programmes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The committee is endorsed and supported by the NZ Mathematical Enrichment Trust, the NZ Association of Mathematics
      Teachers, the NZ Maths Olympiad Students Association, Universities and some companies.
    </p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>
      The NZMOC provides activities for the enrichment and advancement of gifted and talented mathematical students
      under 19 and not enrolled in a university, through their website and hosting an annual week long residential camp
      in January. From this students are selected to attend the International Mathematical Olympiad in July - the
      toughest mathematical competition in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      First competed for in Romania in 1959 the competition has grown to over 100 countries sending teams of up to six.
      This makes it the oldest and largest Olympiad competition. New Zealand has competed with distinction since 1988
