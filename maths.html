    <h3>Who We Are:</h3>

    <p>
      The NZ Mathematics Olympiad Committee is a dedicated committee of University lecturers and students, Mathematics teachers, and interested mathematicians who identify, select and mentor gifted and talented students through an annual programme of participation in international Olympiad competitions to give them an immense kick start to their mathematical careers. In turn former Olympians contribute to the next generations programmes by joining the committee and running the mentor programmes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The committee is endorsed and supported by the NZ Mathematical Enrichment Trust, the NZ Association of Mathematics Teachers, the NZ Maths Olympiad Students Association, Universities and some companies.

    <h3>Objectives:</h3>

    <p>
      The NZMOC provides activities for the enrichment and advancement of gifted and talented mathematical students under 19 and not enrolled in a university, through their website and hosting an annual week long residential camp in January.  From this students are selected to attend the International Mathematical Olympiad in July - the toughest mathematical competition in the world.
