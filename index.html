        <p>
            SONZ is very fortunate to be able to call on the expertise of a
            number of educational experts in the delivery of the various

            The different teams have been highly successful over the years on
            the international stage and very regularly achieving Bronze or
            Silver medals and as was seen in 2015, a Gold medal in the Geography
            competition.
