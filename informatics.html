    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
      NZOI is organised by a group of people who are keen to share their enjoyment of informatics with New Zealand
      students. This group includes teachers, professional programmers, and university students. Many in the group have
      been through the NZOI training programme and competed in an International Olympiad in Informatics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group runs a programming contest which has several events throughout the year. It also holds a training camp
      in January each year to which the top programming students are invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group relies heavily on sponsorship from tertiary organisations and business. The sponsorship subsidises the
      society’s activities including the supervising adults who are required to accompany the students selected to
      compete in the international olympiad event. In recent years we have been very fortunate to have the generous
      support of Jane Street.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
      The society provides training opportunities in Informatics to selected New Zealand students who are currently
      enrolled in a New Zealand secondary school. The society selects, from those it has trained, students to attend the
      International Olympiad in Informatics. The society endeavours to foster informatics in New Zealand secondary
      schools. The society aims to be a non-profit group with all funds going to fulfill the purposes above.
