    <h3>Who We Are:</h3>

    <p>
      NZIBO is organised by teachers, professionals working in the field of Biology and university students, keen to
      share their passion for Biology with New Zealand students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our August entry exam profiles current New Zealand research and asks students to read information, interpret
      graphs and use evidence to make decisions. Successful students enter a well-supported online tutorial programme
      using the Campbell and Reece Text; Biology and Pearson’s MasteringBiology online resources. Regular assignments
      are administered online by Education Perfect. Students study from August until February, with a break during NCEA
      exams. A fabulous ten-day residential training camp at Easter is the reward for the top 20 – 30 students from
      the tutorial programme. Camp selection is determined via an online exam in February/March. Campers complete
      laboratory practicals, field surveys and ecological studies while competing for the four places in the team that
      travels to represent NZ at the International Biology Olympiad.

    <p>
      The group relies heavily on sponsorship from tertiary organisations and business. All NZIBO organisers are
      volunteers and include program alumni in their ranks. We hope you will join us.

    <h3>Objectives:</h3>
    <p>NZIBO endeavours to foster excellence in biology and systems thinking in New Zealand secondary school students.</p>
    <p>
      New Zealand representation is offered to New Zealand students who are New Zealand secondary school students who
      have been enrolled at a NZ secondary school for two years. NZIBO selects, from those it has trained, students to attend the
      International Olympiad in Biology.

    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>
      The 28th IBO was held in Warwick, United Kingdom in July 2017, in Vietnam 2016, in Denmark 2015 and Bali 2014. The
      2018 IBO will be in Iran.  New Zealand has a strong track record in the event, winning medals every year since it began
      competing in 2005. As well as winning Gold in 2017 and  2011, New Zealand has won a total of fourteen Silvers, and 27
      Bronzes, and is one of the few countries to have won medals at every year of entry.
