  In 2024, I attended the 35th International Biology Olympiad in Astana, Kazakhstan. As one of 286 students from 74 countries, I participated in a rich programme of science, culture, and connection. I had the opportunity to participate in four incredibly challenging and diverse practical biology labs in bioinformatics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and animal anatomy/physiology. We were privileged to take part in these labs in the grandiose Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan’s leading academic institution. For me, this was an invaluable exposure to the breadth of high-level work that is pushing the boundaries of biology around the globe today. It assured me that, even coming from a small country like New Zealand, I was capable of being involved in this field. It helped to wash away uncertainty, solidifying my plan to go to university and study either biomedical science or biomedical engineering.

  Even before being selected for the NZ team, being a part of the NZIBO programme was so influential in making me believe in myself. It presented me with resources, connections, a challenge to climb towards, and the assurance that I was in the right place on my pathway into the biological sciences. The community that it created around me has been one that has supported me and energised me for an exciting future. I’m sure that in many years, I’ll still be in contact with (or even working with) the people I’ve met through NZIBO

  Luca received a bronze medal in the 35th International Biology Olympiad and achieved nine scholarships (Premier Award) in the 2024 NZQA Scholarship examinations. Luca made history as the first Māori student to compete on the Olympiad world stage. He is currently enrolled at the University of Auckland studying Biomedical Science and has since accepted an offer from Yale.
