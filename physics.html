        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
            The International Young Physicists’ Tournament (IYPT) is a
            competition created in the USSR to foster scientific research and
            improved international communication in Physics. It is an annual
            team competition for high school physics students which had its
            first international event in 1988.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IYPT is a major international Physics competition with students
            from high schools across the world taking part in the “World Cup of
            Physics”. Students participating in IYPT are selected by their
            member organisations in countries around the world due to a balance
            of theoretical and practical physics as well as an ability to
            communicate complex concepts to an audience and think on their feet!
            All of the IYPT problems and discussions in the debates during the
            tournament take place in English.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each country is represented by a national team consisting of five
            students. In the August prior to the competition seventeen complex
            open-ended problems are released for the team to theoretically and
            experimentally research. At the competition the teams present and
            defend the validity of their problem solutions against teams from
            other countries in structured debates called “Physics Fights”. Jury
            panels consisting of university lecturers, industrial physicists and
            physics teachers rate the student’s report findings and the quality
            of their explanations when questioned by an opposing team.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early part of the school year individual students from any
            school can apply to represent New Zealand in IYPT. Students carry
            out research and present their findings to the National Organising
            Committee in a series of interviews. The five most successful
            students are selected by the NOC to represent NZ in IYPT.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the international competition, IYPT, New Zealand
            students have the option to participate in a national school-based
            competition NZYPT. This competition uses a subset of seven problems
            from the seventeen problems in IYPT. The IYPT problems are announced
            in (approx.) August of the previous year. A school can enter up to
            two teams consisting of three students in each team. Teams can be
            composed of students from more than one school if requird. The teams
            have the option to compete face to face or via “ZOOM” type online
            debates. The top team from this competition receives the NZYPT top
            school trophy and the 2nd and 3rd placed teams are awarded medals.
            The top team as well as individual students whose research is of a
            sufficiently high standard are considered for New Zealand
            representation in IYPT. We rely on the generous support of the New
            Zealand Royal Society, the New Zealand Institute of Physics,
            tertiary institutions and the Physics teaching community to carry
            out this event annually.
        </p>

        <h3>Objectives of NZYPT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                to stimulate and enhance the interests of students from the
                secondary schools in physics and another branches of knowledge
            </li>
            <li>
                to increase connections between schools and tertiary / research
                institutions
            </li>
            <li>
                to develop scientific, thinking, investigation, communication
                and presentation skills
            </li>
            <li>to enhance teamwork and leadership skills</li>
            <li>
                to enrich the national curriculum studied by school students and
                promote a desire to participate in areas of engineering and
                scientific specialities - especially in the area of hi-tech
                industry
            </li>
            <li>
                to stimulate teacher’s knowledge of Physics and encourage them
                to go beyond their national curriculum to make links with
                scientists during the preparation and participation in NZYPT
            </li>
            <li>
                to popularize the NZYPT / IYPT widely among schools and
                universities seeking new forms of collaboration between them.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            New Zealand has competed in IYPT since 2003 and New Zealand teams
            have a strong reputation in the event where our highly respected
            teams are regularly awarded medals. The competition is all about
            problem solving, teamwork, thinking outside of the square and
            explaining complex scientific ideas concisely. NZYPT is proud to
            excite student interest in Physics and encourage diversity and
            creativity in student focussed research. The four students who have
            won Te Puiaki Kaipūtaiao Ānamata - The Prime Minister’s Future
            Scientist Prize after taking part in IYPT reflect the all-round
            ability required to do well in this tournament.

        <h3>2024 Results</h3>
        <p>
            IYPT 2024 was held in Budapest, Hungary from 10th – 17th July. This
            was the first international outing for a New Zealand team since 2019
            (Poland) due to Covid-19 and international travel restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final IYPT results were : Gold medals to 1st place to Singapore,
            Ukraine in 2nd , Poland in 3rd and Chinese Taipei in 4th.
        </p>
        <p>
            New Zealand gained bronze medals in 13th place overall ahead of old
            rivals Australia (15th), the USA (23rd) and the UK (28th) so once
            again team New Zealand can be proud of their research solutions and
            ability to debate their conclusions.

            The 2024 New Zealand team of Emilio Gray (New Plymouth Boys), Tong
            (Charlie) Li (ACG Parnell), Matthew McKee (Auckland Grammar), Alison
            Power (Onslow College), Yinuo (Belle) Yin (St Cuthbert’s) with team
            leader Eric Coufmann is shown below.

        <h3>IYPT problems</h3>
        <p>
            To get a flavour of one of the 2023 IYPT problems called “Fractal
            fingers” students were asked to investigate the effect of fractal
            fingering. This can be observed if a droplet of an ink-alcohol
            mixture is deposited onto diluted acrylic paint.
        </p>
        <p>
            The research required them to investigate how the geometry and
            dynamics of the fingers were influenced by relevant parameters. Here
            is a picture from one of the student projects.
